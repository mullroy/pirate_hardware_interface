# pirate hardware interface
This software provides a Qt based GUI interface to communicate with the Pirate Hardware Wallet. 

The software currently runs on Linux, macOS X (native) and M$ Windows (Cygwin). View INSTALL_linux, INSTALL_mac and INSTALL_windows on how to build and run the GUI application on your preferred system.
