# pirate hardware interface
This software provides a Qt based GUI interface to communicate with the Pirate Hardware Wallet. 

The software currently runs on Linux, macOS X (native) and M$ Windows (Cygwin). View INSTALL_linux, INSTALL_mac and INSTALL_windows on how to build and run the GUI application on your preferred system.

The version 2 GUI series (2.3 - 2.6) is incompatible with hardware wallets that are internally running versions 1.1 or 1.2. View UPGRADE.md for instructions on how to upgrade the hardware wallet, or alternatively, to downgrade the GUI down to version 1.2
