# pirate_hardware_interface
This software provides a Qt based GUI interface to communicate with the Pirate Hardware Wallet. 

The software currently runs on Linux (native) and on M$ Windows (Cygwin). View INSTALL_linux and INSTALL_windows on how to build and run the GUI application.

The latest GUI version (2.3) is incompatible with hardware wallets that are internally running versions 1.1 or 1.2. View UPGRADE.md for instructions on how
to upgrade the hardware wallet, or alternatively, to downgrade the GUI down to version 1.2
